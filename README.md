## Description
A game that is played by two players by rolling a dice. To win a game, a player should score 100 points.

***

### How to play
On a turn, a player rolls the die repeatedly. The goal is to accumulate as many points as possible, adding up the numbers rolled on the die.
However, if a player rolls a 1, the player's turn is over and any points they have accumulated during this turn are forfeited.
Rolling a 1 doesn't wipe out your entire score, just the total earned during that particular roll.
