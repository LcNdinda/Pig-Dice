## Description
A game that is played by two players by rolling a dice. To win a game, a player should score 100 points.

***

### How to play
On a turn, a player rolls the die repeatedly. The goal is to accumulate as many points as possible, adding up the numbers rolled on the die.
However, if a player rolls a 1, the player's turn is over and any points they have accumulated during this turn are forfeited.
Rolling a 1 doesn't wipe out your entire score, just the total earned during that particular roll.

A player can also choose to hold (stop rolling) if they do not want to take a chance of rolling a 1 and losing all of their points from this turn. If the player chooses to hold, all of the points rolled during that turn are added to his or her score.

When a player reaches a total of 100 or more points, the game ends and that player is the winner.

## Behaviour Driven Development
1. The program allows players to switch turns.

    **INPUT EXAMPLE:** Press Hold Button.
    
    **OUTPUT EXAMPLE:** Roll Dice Button switches to player 2 from player1
    
2. The program allows players to roll the dice

    **INPUT EXAMPLE:** Player 1  clicks on rolls Dice;
    
    **OUTPUT EXAMPLE:** 6
    
3. The program displays rolled dice results

    **INPUT EXAMPLE:** Roll Dice
    
    **OUTPUT EXAMPLE** Displays 3

4. The program returns a zero when the dice roll is 1

     **INPUT EXAMPLE:** Roll 1
     
     **OUTPUT EXAMPLE:** You rolled a 1, score is Zero
 
5. The program adds and display total results of the dice rolled
      
      **INPUT EXAMPLE** 3,4,5
      
      **OUTPUT EXAMPLE** 12
      
 6. The program changes the roll dice button between players when they click on hold
 
      **INPUT EXAMPLE** player1 clicks on "HOLD"
      
      **OUTPUT EXAMPLE** change the roll dice option to player2
